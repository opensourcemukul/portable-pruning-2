# 🔧 Portable Pruning

**Data-Free. Device-Agnostic. Simple CNN Pruning for Edge Devices.**

This is a modular and clean framework to help you experiment with pruning deep learning models like `ResNet18`, `ResNet34`, and `MobileNetV2`. The best part — you don’t need any training data for pruning. It’s built for people who want to deploy compressed models on edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or Android phones.

## 🔍 What it Can Do

- ✅ Works without any training data  
- 🧱 Device-agnostic — models run on various edge hardware  
- 🔄 Easy-to-plug pruning strategies  
- 📏 Measures: FLOPs, Params, Latency, RAM, Accuracy  
- 📤 Exports `.pth` and `.onnx` for deployment  
- 📊 Logs every experiment in a CSV automatically

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portable-pruning.git
cd portable-pruning
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have issues with importing the `portable_pruning` module, add it to your path:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
```

### 🔹 Step 3: Dataset

By default, the code uses `imagenette2-320`. You don’t need to train anything — just prune and evaluate.

## 🧠 Models Available

- `resnet18` — lightweight and fast  
- `resnet34` — deeper but still efficient  
- `mobilenet_v2` — made for mobile deployment  

All are from `torchvision.models` and come pretrained.

## ✂️ Pruning Methods

| Method      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `l1`        | Unstructured pruning (L1 norm) |
| `batchnorm` | Based on BatchNorm gamma values |
| `red`       | Redundancy-based with KDE (`alpha`, `tau`) |
| `redpp`     | Lighter version of RED |
| `builtin`   | PyTorch’s pruning API |
| `autodfp`   | RL-based (Auto Deep Filter Pruning) |

---

## 🧰 Pruning Modes (For `builtin` Method Only)

Here are the four available pruning modes (used with the `builtin` method):

- `l1_unstructured` – Removes individual weights with the lowest L1 norm.
- `ln_structured` – Drops entire filters or channels using structured norms.
- `random_structured` – Randomly removes full structures (like channels).
- `random_unstructured` – Randomly removes individual weights.

Use these based on whether you want structured sparsity (good for speed-up) or unstructured sparsity (good for compression).

## 🚀 Run It (Your Way)

### 🔸 Prune a Model

```bash
python run_pruning.py   --model resnet18   --method builtin   --mode l1_unstructured   --compression 0.5   --onnx   --output_dir .outputs/my_run
```

### 🔸 Just Evaluate Baseline (No Pruning)

```bash
python run_pruning.py   --model resnet18   --method builtin   --mode l1_unstructured   --compression 0.5   --baseline   --onnx   --output_dir .outputs/my_run
```

---

## 🧪 Run a Full Experiment Grid

```bash
python experiment.py --subset_size 100 --results_file results.csv
```

This will go through all models, compressions, and modes in one shot.

Results saved to:

```
.outputs/run_<timestamp>/
results.csv
```
